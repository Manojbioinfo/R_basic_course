# 🫁 LUAD (Lung Adenocarcinoma) Data Analysis in R

---

## 📌 1. Introduction  
Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most common types of lung cancer and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Analyzing clinical and demographic patient data helps identify disease patterns, risk factors, and supports better treatment strategies.

In this tutorial, we will work with a LUAD dataset containing variables such as age, gender, smoking status, tumor stage, and race. The goal is to perform data loading, cleaning, exploration, and basic statistical analysis using R.

---

## 📥 2. Download the Dataset  

The dataset used in this tutorial is publicly available.

🔗 **Dataset Source:**  
https://github.com/Manojbioinfo/R_basic_course/blob/main/Data/LUAD_clean_data_all_patients.csv  

👉 Click the link → select **"Raw"** → right-click → **Save As** to download the file.  

Place the file in your R working directory before proceeding.

---

## 📌 3. Workspace Preparation  

```r
# Clear workspace
rm(list = ls())
```

**Interpretation:**  
This ensures a clean working environment and avoids conflicts with previously stored variables.

---

## 📦 4. Load Required Libraries  

```r
# Install (run once only)
# install.packages("tidyverse")

# Load library
library(tidyverse)
```


Below message is **automatically printed by R when you load tidyverse**. 


```
── Attaching core tidyverse packages ───────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──
✔ dplyr     1.2.1     ✔ readr     2.2.0
✔ forcats   1.0.1     ✔ stringr   1.6.0
✔ ggplot2   4.0.2     ✔ tibble    3.3.1
✔ lubridate 1.9.5     ✔ tidyr     1.3.2
✔ purrr     1.2.1     

── Conflicts ───────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
ℹ Use the conflicted package to force all conflicts to become errors
```


**Interpretation:**  
The tidyverse package provides tools for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

This output confirms that the tidyverse package and its core components have been successfully loaded.  

The “conflicts” message indicates that some functions (such as `filter()` and `lag()`) from dplyr override functions with the same name from base R (stats package). This is normal and does not cause errors in most analyses.

## 📂 5. Load the Dataset  

```r
# Load dataset
Data <- read.csv("LUAD_clean_data_all_patients.csv")
```

---
## 🔍 Preview of the Dataset

```r
# View first few rows of the dataset
head(Data)
```

**Output:**

```

**Interpretation:**  
The `head()` function displays the first six observations of the dataset, providing a quick overview of the data structure and values.  

From this preview, we can confirm that:
- The variables are properly organized and readable  
- Both numerical and categorical data are present  
This step helps verify data quality before proceeding with analysis.

```

**Interpretation:**  
The `summary()` function provides an overview of both numerical and categorical variables in the dataset.

- **Age:**  
  The average age is **65.2 years**, with values ranging from **33 to 88 years**. The median age (66) is close to the mean, suggesting a fairly symmetric distribution.

- **Cigarettes per day:**  
  The mean is **1.51**, while the median is **1.10**, indicating a slightly right-skewed distribution. A minimum of 0 suggests that some individuals do not smoke.

- **Categorical variables (Gender, Race, Vital_Status, Pathologic_stage, Age_Group):**  
  These are currently stored as character variables and summarized by their length rather than frequencies, indicating the need for conversion to factors for better analysis.

Overall, the dataset appears consistent, with no obvious missing values shown in the summary, and is suitable for further statistical analysis after minor preprocessing.

## 🧹 6. Data Cleaning  

### 🔍 Check for Missing Values

Before starting any analysis, it’s important to check if your dataset contains missing values.

#### ▶️ Run the following code:

```r
# Check missing values in each column
colSums(is.na(Data))
```

#### ✅ Output:

```r
                ID                Age             Gender               Race       Vital_Status   Pathologic_stage Cigarettes_per_day          Age_Group 
                 0                  0                  0                  0                  0                  0                  0                  0 
```

---

### ✅ Interpretation

- Each column shows **0 missing values**
- This means your dataset is **complete**
- No need for data cleaning related to missing values

## 📈 8. Data Visualization  

```r
# Histogram of Age distribution
hist(Data$Age,
     col = "lightblue",
     main = "Age Distribution",
     xlab = "Age")
```

<img src="images/LUAD_Pic1.jpg" alt="Plot" width="60%">

```r
# Histogram of Cigarettes per day
hist(Data$Cigarettes_per_day,
     col = "tomato",
     main = "Cigarettes_per_day Distribution",
     xlab = "Cigarettes_per_day")

```

<img src="images/LUAD_Pic2.jpg" alt="Plot" width="60%">

```r
# Bar plots
barplot(table(Data$Gender),
        col = "pink",
        main = "Gender Distribution")
```

<img src="images/LUAD_Pic3.jpg" alt="Plot" width="60%">

```r
barplot(table(Data$Tumor_Stage),
        col = "lightgreen",
        main = "Tumor Stage Distribution")
```
<img src="images/LUAD_Pic4.jpg" alt="Plot" width="60%">

**Interpretation:**  

Visualizations provide an intuitive understanding of data patterns and distributions.

---

## 📉 9. Relationship Analysis  

```r
# Scatter plot
plot(Data$Age, Data$Smoking,
     xlab = "Age",
     ylab = "Cigarettes per Day",
     main = "Age vs Smoking")
```
<img src="images/LUAD_Pic5.jpg" alt="Plot" width="60%">


```r
# Regression line
abline(lm(Smoking ~ Age, data = Data), col = "red")
```
<img src="images/LUAD_Pic6.jpg" alt="Plot" width="60%">

**Interpretation:** 

This explores the relationship between age and smoking behavior, helping identify trends.

---

## 📊 10. Correlation Analysis  

```r
cor(Data$Age, Data$Smoking, use = "complete.obs")
```

```
0.04594092
```

**Interpretation:**  
Correlation measures the strength and direction of association between two numerical variables.  

Values range from -1 to +1:  
- Close to +1 → strong positive relationship  
- Close to -1 → strong negative relationship  
- Close to 0 → no relationship  

Our result, i.e, 0.04594092 means:

> As **age increases, cigarettes per day *very slightly* increase**, but the relationship is so weak that it’s basically **no real relationship at all**.

So:

> There is a negligible positive relationship between age and cigarettes per day, indicating essentially no meaningful association.

## 📦 11. Boxplots  

```r
# Age by Tumor Stage
boxplot(Age ~ Tumor_Stage, data = Data,
        col = "orange",
        main = "Age by Tumor Stage")
```
<img src="images/LUAD_Pic7.jpg" alt="Plot" width="60%">


```r
# Age by Race
boxplot(Age ~ Race, data = Data,
        col = "purple",
        main = "Age by Race")
```
<img src="images/LUAD_Pic8.jpg" alt="Plot" width="60%">

**Interpretation:**  
Boxplots compare distributions across groups and help detect variability and outliers.

---

## 💾 12. Saving Output  

```r
jpeg("luad_plot.jpg", width = 2000, height = 1500, res = 300)

boxplot(Age ~ Race, data = Data,
        col = "purple",
        main = "Age by Race")

dev.off()

```

**Interpretation:**  
This allows saving visual outputs for reports and presentations. The above plot will be saved as luad_plot.jpg in the current working directory
